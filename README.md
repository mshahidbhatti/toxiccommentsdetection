# toxiccommentsdetection
This repository contains a Python code implementation for classifying toxic comments in the Urdu language using various machine learning algorithms. The classification models are trained and evaluated on the UTOX20 dataset, which comprises 20,000 toxic comments written in Urdu.
The code provides an efficient and comprehensive approach to automatically identify toxic comments, which can be valuable in applications such as content moderation, online community management, and user safety. The implemented algorithms include Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM).

The classification models are evaluated using multiple performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and Cohen's kappa. These metrics provide insights into the models' ability to accurately classify toxic comments and measure their overall agreement beyond chance.

By sharing this code on GitHub, we aim to contribute to the research and development of toxic comment detection in the Urdu language. The availability of this code allows researchers, developers, and practitioners to reproduce the results, benchmark their own algorithms, and further improve the classification performance on toxic comment datasets.
